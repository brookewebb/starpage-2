            <h3 class="vega">Atlas</h3>
            <p>Atlas, along with its neighboring stars in the Pleiades cluster, formed roughly between 75 and 150 million years ago. The Pleiades cluster is among the closest star clusters to Earth. All the stars here have a common origin, they formed through a gigantic molecular cloud of dust and gas. Gravity pulled the swirling dust and gas together and formed the Pleiades star cluster which is now dominated by the hot blue and luminous stars.

            </p>
            <p>Atlas is located at around 431 light-years / 132 parsecs away from the Sun, and it is 3.92 degrees north of the ecliptic.

                Atlas is more than 2 times bigger than our sun. It has an estimated 2.0 solar radii or 200% the sun’s radius, and 4.74 solar masses or 474% the sun’s mass.</p>
            <p>Atlas is a blue-white giant star of spectral type B8 III radiating more than 1.000 times more energy than our sun, though most of it is in the ultraviolet invisible spectrum. It has surface temperatures of around 13.446 K, thus it is more than 2.3 times hotter than our sun.</p>
            <p>Atlas is a fast-spinning star at an estimated rotational velocity of 280 kilometers / 173.9 miles per second. Because of this, the star ejects so much material that a disk has formed around it.</p>
            <p>The star also varies in brightness and has a companion star orbiting around it. The primary star designated Atlas A has an apparent magnitude of 3.84 while the secondary star designated Atlas B, has an apparent magnitude of 5.46. Both stars in the Atlas star system are variable as the CCDM lists them with magnitudes of 3.8 and 6.8.</p>
            <p>Atlas is located in the zodiacal constellation of Taurus, the celestial bull. It is part of one of the two famous open clusters of the constellation named the Pleiades and the Hyades.</p>

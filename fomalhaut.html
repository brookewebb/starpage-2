            <h3 class="vega">Fomalhaut</h3>
            <p>Fomalhaut is the brightest star in the constellation of Piscis Austrinus. It is the 18th brightest star in the night sky and the first stellar system with an extrasolar planet candidate imaged at visible wavelengths.</p>
            <p>Fomalhaut A formed around 440 million years ago from a molecular cloud or a nebula, of gas and dust. Fomalhaut B seems to be around 400 million years old or even older, this suggests that the stars may be physically related, perhaps they formed at the same time and are now gravitationally bound to each other. Both stars are much younger than our sun, while Fomalhaut C is theorized to be even older than the other two.</p>
            <p>Fomalhaut is around 25 light-years / 7.7 parsecs away from the Sun. The primary star, Fomalhaut A, is almost twice as massive as our Sun, with an estimated 1.91 solar masses and 1.8 solar radii.</p>
            <p>The primary star, Fomalhaut A, is the brightest at around 16.6 times brighter than our sun. Fomalhaut B is much fainter, at only 0.19 solar luminosities. The dimmest star is Fomalhaut C, at only 0.0046 solar luminosities.

            </p>
            <p>The hottest star, is Fomalhaut A, with average surface temperatures of around 8.590 K, the secondary is Fomalhaut B, with temperatures of around 4.711 K. Fomalhaut A appear to have a lower metallicity than our Sun, with 3 studies estimating different percentages of metallicity: 78%, 93%, and the more accurate 2008 spectroscopic measurements – 46% the Sun’s metallicity.</p>
            <p>Perhaps one of the biggest stellar systems in terms of how far the stars stretch from one another. Fomalhaut B is at least 54.000 AU from Fomalhaut A and completes one orbit around it every 7.6 million years, or more. </p>

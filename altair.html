            <h3 class="vega">Altair</h3>
            <p>Altair formed roughly 1.2 billion years ago from a molecular cloud or nebula of gas and dust. Gravity pulled together the swirling gas and dust together to form the eagle star we today now know as Altair. The star seems to have an abundance of iron, and almost twice the heavy elements of the sun.</p>
            <p>Altair has almost double the Sun’s mass, at an estimated 1.79 solar masses, and almost double the Sun’s radius, at around 1.63 solar radii at its poles and at around  2.03 solar radii at its equator due to its oblate shape caused by high rotational speeds. Thus, Altair’s polar diameter is at around 25% smaller than its equatorial diameter.</p>
            <p>Altair is almost 11 times brighter than our sun. It has a visual magnitude of 0.77 and an absolute magnitude of 2.21. It is a variable type of star, classified as a Delta Scuti variable. Its variations in luminosity occur over periods that range from 0.8 to 1.5 hours.</p>
            <p>Altair completes one spin on its axis in around 8.9 hours, our Sun for comparison completes one equatorial rotation at around 25 days. Its fast rotational velocity has been estimated to be around 286 km / 177.7 mi per second. </p>
            <p>Because of its rotational speed, its poles are flattened and the temperatures on its surface vary from its equator to its poles. Temperatures have been estimated to range from 6.900 K at the equator up to 8.500 K at the poles. It may be that due to these temperatures and variations, convention cells who migrate from the hot regions to the cooler regions may produce low-level X-ray emissions.</p>
            <p>Altair is located in the constellation of Aquila – the eagle. It forms a line of stars known as the Shaft of Aquila along with the second and third brightest stars of the constellation. The other two stars are Alshain and Tarazed.</p>

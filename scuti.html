            <h3 class="vega">UY Scuti</h3>
            <p>UY Scuti is a red supergiant star, which is usually an aging star. Stars with a big enough mass transform into red supergiant stars. They are the largest known type of stars. They usually form when a star runs out of hydrogen fuel in their core and begins collapsing.

                The outer shells of hydrogen around the core get hot enough to begin fusion. The shells then expand, and the now cooler star takes on the red color.</p>
            <p>Situated in the Milky Way galaxy in the Scutum constellation, UY Scuti is 5.100 light-years away from us. It is situated just northeast of the famous Eagle Nebula (Messier 16).</p>
            <p>Also home to the famous Delta Scuti variable star, the Scutum constellation contains many relatively bright deep-sky objects that are quite popular targets among stargazers.</p>
            <p>UY Scuti’s exact size is difficult to determine due to its pulsation. However, recent estimates in 2019 have made the planet a bit smaller due to its change in temperature.  The radius has dropped – it now has 1708 times the radius of our Sun.</p>

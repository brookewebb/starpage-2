            <p>Polaris or the North Star is a star that appears almost directly above the Earth's rotational axis. As the Earth turns, every other star seems to spin around the axis, tracing out a circle in the sky, but the North Star appears to stand still. But no matter what time of night or what season it is, following Polaris will lead a traveler in the Northern Hemisphere due north. </p>
            <p>Polaris is part of the constellation known as Ursa Minor and the cluster of stars called the Little Dipper.

                The North Star is not the star closest to us, nor is it the brightest star in the night sky. But culturally, scientifically and navigationally, it's one of the most important stars of recent centuries. </p>
            <p>Polaris is a "pulsing" star, a type of star also known as a Cepheid variable, which means that it appears to vary in brightness ever so slightly — only one tenth of a magnitude — over a time frame of just under four days. </p>
            <p>If you train a small backyard telescope on Polaris, you might notice a tiny companion star (called Polaris B) shining at 9th magnitude with a pale bluish tint. This companion was first sighted by William Herschel in 1779, reported astronomer Bob Argyle and co-authors in the 2019 book "An Anthology of Visual Double Stars."</p>
            <p>Astronomers believe that the main star and Polaris B are separated by about 2,400 astronomical units — one astronomical unit (AU) being the average distance of the sun to the Earth. The orbital period of the two stars may number in the many thousands of years.</p>
            <p>In 1929, by studying the spectrum of Polaris, a third companion star (Polaris C) was discovered. This one, a white dwarf, lies only 18.5 AU from Polaris A (about the same distance of the planet Uranus from our sun). Its extreme closeness to the far more brilliant Polaris A explains why it went unseen for so long.</p>

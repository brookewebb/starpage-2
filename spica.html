            <h3 class="vega">Spica</h3>
            <p>
                Spica is a bright binary star, the 16th brightest in Earth's night sky, visible in the northern
                constellation Virgo. It is visible not only because of its size, but also because of its relatively
                close distance: it is about 260 light-years away from Earth.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the star appears as a single point of light to the naked eye, Spica is a binary system. One star,
                however, is much brighter than the other one.
            </p>
            <p>Spica is a little hard to spot, so astronomers sometimes use other stars to find it. Starting from the
                handle of the Big Dipper, one common phrase used among amateurs goes: "follow the arc to Arcturus and
                speed on to Spica."</p>
            <p>The name "Spica" derives from a Latin phrase saying that Virgo is holding an "ear of grain" or "ear of
                wheat." It also was noted and named in other ancient cultures, such as Arabic, Chinese and Hindu. Legend
                commonly connects Virgo to Dike, the Greek goddess of justice, and Persephone, the daughter of Demeter,
                the harvest goddess. </p>
            <p>It wasn't until the invention of the telescope that it became clear that Spica is a binary star. The two
                stars orbit each other at just 12 percent the equivalent distance between Earth and the sun.</p>
            <p>The two stars, according to Jim Kaler, a professor emeritus of astronomy at the University of Illinois,
                are both class B stars, with the brighter one "nearing the end of its stable lifetime." According to
                NASA, the primary star is roughly double the sun's size and almost 2,000 times as bright. </p>
            <p>It was once thought that the binaries' variability in brightness was because one star was passing in
                front of the other and dimming its light.
                More recent measurements show that it's likely because the stars tidally distort each other with their
                close proximity. They whirl so close to each other than an orbit only takes four days to complete.</p>
